# Homework 02: Quadratic Equation Solver

### Requirements

  * The program should give all roots including imaginary ones
  * If the coefficients constitute a linear equation you should calculate the single root.
  * Input:
    * Three coefficients (a, b, and c respectively) on a single line separated by spaces.
  * Output:
    * The equation being solved.
    * Roots
      * Each root on a separate line
      * If there is more than one root, tehn the one obtained by subtraction is first
      * Roots should be reported as
        * `x = <number>`
        * `x = <number> + <number>i`
        
          *Note that there is a single space on either side of an '=', a '+', or a '-'*
      * If no valid solutions can be calculated, then output:
      
        `Unable to determine root(s).`
      * Note that `endl` puts a line return at the end. You should not put one after your lst line of output.
